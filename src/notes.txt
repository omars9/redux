redux : state management library for javaScript
===> applications react angular vue js

props : parent ==> child 

passing data from A to D, we would have to pass by B and C

redux gave us a new way of handling state, we sotre in a global store in our app

every component that needs to access data, dispatches an action

redux flow
----

components dispatches ACTIONS, the REDUCER reads the ACTION and modifies the STORE
depending on the ACTION TYPE

ACTION:

javaScript object

const act = {
    type: string ex: DELETE
    payload(optional)
}

to eleminate typos (fautes de frappe) we create an actionTypes file and declare all
the action types

REDUCER:

function that takes the action and the state as parameters and returns the new state

SOTRE:
function that takes the reducer as parameter
